## Short Stories

I started writing creatively after my father passed away suddenly, a week before my 26th birthday. His artistic talent and jest for life, muddled by the pursuits of life, left this world suddenly which inspired me to tap into the creativity inside me. And it started with short stories and is turning into much more.
