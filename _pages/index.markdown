## Developer, Writer, Artist, Athlete, and Lover of Life

Welcome to my website!

“Less is More,” to me is a quote, phrase, and way of being. It has taken me more than 27 years of life to come to peace with this idea. It underlies most of the blogs, essays, and work that I publish. I hope you find my website simple, archaic, and flat out boring. That is by choice. Inspired by Paul Graham’s website, a prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneur. 

In most aspects of my life. The way I decorate my apartment, the clothes I choose to buy, the items I choose to have, the workout routine I follow, the food I eat and what I choose to cook, the developer tools I choose to use and skills I want to grow, the mentors I choose to follow, the choice of ignoring the vast echo chamber of possibilities idealized on social media, the city and type of life I want to live, where I want to travel too, the way I wanted to design my website, and everything in between follows this mindset. 

The common essence in all of this to takeaway is the word, “choose.” It is my choice. It is my chosen path to the best and most fulfilling life I want to live. It’s not something I thought would happen to me when I was full of excitement about the possibilities of this world when I went to college at 18 or moved to Chicago at 23, but it is how I choose to live to find my joy and perform my best today.

All that being said, here is the tech stack that underlies this website. (Last updated August 2024)
