## Novels

None of my own are ready for public publishing. Many ideas are in the works, maybe in a few years I’ll have something published. In the meantime, here is a living list of some of my favorite novels and authors that I use for inspiration.

* Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
* One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
* Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford
* The Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri
* The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri
* Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts
* The Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown
