This was a poem written by a friend of my father's after his sudden passing followed by a response written by me. This was my first introduction to expressing creativity through writing and I consider this fictional prose my first foray into short stories.

**Sandeep Talks to Us; Rahul Responds**

*by Amar Nehru & Rahul Singal*

The bells chimed

I was born, a system in this world

I was a loving son, brother, went to school, college

Rode my motorbike, wooed my love, cherished her

Adored our children

I lived passionately, connected deeply and entertained with abandon

I left my heart on the carpet along with some stains of wine

I photographed the world in all of its vibrance and splendor 

The “Road not Taken” or the “Road less traveled” mattered less to me than the immediacy and preciousness of the moment

I too groped at the unknown with uncertain hands

But I ran the race hard, briefly, through the infinity of time
                                       
                2

Till the hour struck 

The bells tolled 

The clock ceased

A system was lost

And this spirit abandoned the vehicle

And mingled with the souls

                3

Do not mourn for me, weep or shed tears for me

I’m in a good place, a better place

The void will be there to feel

For a while, a long while

But the relentless passage of time will make the void heal

Instead celebrate me, in your way, if I’ve touched your heart, your soul 

Did I touch your heart, your soul? 

Did I prepare you for this life? 

                4

From my elevated drone-like perch 

I will look out for you, my loved ones, family and friends

From where I am

I see arid patches, verdant meadows and groves of tall trees

And they all merge into one

They look the same; cast your differences aside

Eat, drink, love, commit to one another and pray

Take care. With love. Till later. Sandeep. EOM.


**Rahul Singal’s Response**

Sandeep, my dear father. Daddy. 

You asked a question: did you prepare me for this life?

Here’s my response: Yes, unequivocally. 

At my college graduation, we talked at length about family and upbringing. The pursuits and journey of your father – Dada. The pursuits and journey of my mother’s father – Baba. From the outside looking in, it may seem that everything was handed to us on a silver platter. But behind the veil, the curtain, there is always, more to the story. Entrenched in family. 

For us – we fought, argued, challenged, and questioned one another. I egged you on and pushed you at moments, when you were at your lowest; unbeknownst to me. Loving & warm on the onset, but an ability to turn on a dime into a state of regret and absolute despair. Which led to resentment and questioning your two-faced nature. Answers I would not get till later. 

When I thought that you lived with a glass half empty point of view, I was wrong. My understanding of the glass was naïve and incomplete. See, when we are born, we all have a full glass. An ability to live free spirited and passionately. Which you did to level’s unattainable by most. But when your kids are born – half your glass is put into the child from each to give them a full glass. Thus, halving yours and leaving you with a void for which we are to fill. This is only the natural course of life, which I was yet to understand until your death. 

But to the outside world – you flipped this natural expectation. You lived vibrantly through everything. You were an artist. A true lover of life and full of passion. Food, wine, photography, sports, music, travel, reading. A man full of conviction and absence of any sinew of malice. Long winded and running feverously through this life. Because it was yours. One thousand burpees on the path to your success’s. Whatever you did Daddy, you gave your heart to it. And stayed strong. 

And in the end, we loved. Greatly. Briefly. But pure. We were misunderstood, but then, understood. We grew up in two different worlds, but in the end, we created our world. Your glass may be emptied out, soul dancing and singing with the angels. And George Michael. But my glass is once again full. And I am singing and dancing with you as well, through the infinity of time. 

Love. Your son. Rahul. EOM.
